<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as services and entrepreneurs switch from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. PBX represents personal branch exchange, which is an expensive term for a business phone system. Business VoIP phone service has been advancing over the past decade.
