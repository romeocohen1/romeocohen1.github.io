<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as entrepreneurs and businesses change from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. PBX represents private branch exchange, which is an elegant term for a business phone system. Business VoIP phone service has been advancing over the past decade. Other than the delivery technique, there are no differences in between a VoIP calls and a traditional telephone call. You can also position or get call through multiple devices (desk phone, computer, cellphone, tablet, and so on) with VoIP, and in general, the sound quality is just much better (with the proper internet setup and bandwidth accessibility, that is).</p>

Calls in between VoIP and the analogue network are enabled by devices (such as Media Gateways) developing connections between them.</p>
